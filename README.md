### Main Panel

![MainPanel](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/e9348ba6-5fb8-4d33-b96f-9adb4f76a1d8)

The `Main Panel` will help you organize the audio files in your project.
You can separate the music into 3 different categories:
- `BGM` (Background Music)
- `ABGM` (Adaptive Background Music)
- `BGS` (Background Sounds)

#### **Audio Directories**

![Directories](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/43df5d91-49a7-4f7c-ad4b-018936f2d3ab)

You will have to assign a directory for each category, `Main Panel` will look in all the subfolders for audio files with the extensions selected in **Audio Extensions**.
With the *search* button you can view the files found in the directories.

*`Note`: ABGM will search only .tscn files, as it will use only the scenes created with AdaptiveTrack, or ParallelTrack*

#### **Audio Bus**

![Bus](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/85044888-b568-4134-9d89-39cfede581b7)

Here you can assign an audio *BUS* for each category. This will help with later in-game audio volume management.

#### **Debug and ABGS Support**

![Debugging](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/138b7e7d-3bd2-47e5-b860-3a06a794b796)

- `Debugging`: You will be able to see the plugin's operation in the output panel.
- `ABGS Support`: It will allow you to add scenes with AdaptiveTrack or ParallelTrack nodes in the BGS category.


### AudioManager Singleton
![AudioManager](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/8bdfc8b4-9ede-4844-9335-7db9dfebbd91)

`AudioManager` will automatically preload audio files for when `playback methods` are called.

**Playback Methods**

![play_music](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/d97fedf0-1d24-4194-8f92-d716bc403764)


This method will play from the beginning the audio with the name assigned in *sound_name*. If there is already an audio being played, it will replace it, unless it is the same one, in which case, it will continue the current playback.

- `sound_name:` with this argument type `String`, `AudioManager` will look for the preloaded sounds and play audio with this name.
- `volume_db:` argument type `Float`, set volume in dB of the track when played. *0.0 default*
- `fade_in:` argument type `Float`, set the fade time when the track is played. *0.5 default*
- `fade_out:` argument type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out. *1.5 default*
- `skip_intro:` **only for AdaptiveTrack**, `Bool` if true, play the loop directly. *false default*
- `loop_index:` **only for AdaptiveTrack**, `Int` sets the index of the loop to be played after the intro. *0 default*


![reset_music](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/4061983a-3a92-42d2-8f0e-76ce33332c9d)

This method returns the currently playing track to the beginning.
- `fade_out:` argument type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out. *0.0 default*
- `fade_in:` argument type `Float`, set the fade time when the track is played. *0.0 default*


![stop_music](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/b3fd1554-36d5-4dca-9399-cb5d6a2ccafd)
