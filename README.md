### Main Panel

![MainPanel](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/e9348ba6-5fb8-4d33-b96f-9adb4f76a1d8)

The `Main Panel` will help you organize the audio files in your project.
You can separate the music into 3 different categories:
- `BGM` (Background Music)
- `ABGM` (Adaptive Background Music)
- `BGS` (Background Sounds)

#### **Audio Directories**

![Directories](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/43df5d91-49a7-4f7c-ad4b-018936f2d3ab)

You will have to assign a directory for each category, `Main Panel` will look in all the subfolders for audio files with the extensions selected in **Audio Extensions**.
With the *search* button you can view the files found in the directories.

*`Note`: ABGM will search only .tscn files, as it will use only the scenes created with AdaptiveTrack, or ParallelTrack*

#### **Audio Bus**

![Bus](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/85044888-b568-4134-9d89-39cfede581b7)

Here you can assign an audio *BUS* for each category. This will help with later in-game audio volume management.

#### **Debug and ABGS Support**

![Debugging](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/138b7e7d-3bd2-47e5-b860-3a06a794b796)

- `Debugging`: You will be able to see the plugin's operation in the output panel.
- `ABGS Support`: It will allow you to add scenes with AdaptiveTrack or ParallelTrack nodes in the BGS category.


## AudioManager Singleton

This tool is designed with the objective of implementing global background music and/or sounds. `AudioManager` will only play a single `BGM` or `ABGM` track, and in parallel one of `BGS`.

- The `current_playback` variable stores the only currently playing BGM or ABGM.
- The `current_bgs_playback` variable stores the only current playback of the BGS.

![AudioManager](https://github.com/MrWalkmanDev/AdaptiSound/assets/109055491/8bdfc8b4-9ede-4844-9335-7db9dfebbd91)

`AudioManager` will automatically preload audio files for when `playback methods` are called.

*Only add_track method and play_music method add an instance to the `AudioManager` tree in the container with its category.*

## Playback Methods
