# AudioSynchronized
Inherits from the AdaptiNode class.
AudioSynchronized is a node that allows multiple tracks to play simultaneously in parallel. Each track is a layer and can be controlled individually.

To access this node, you must create a scene with the AudioSynchronized node and save it to the "Audio Scene Preload" directory in AudioPanel to preload the file.

It can also be loaded dynamically using the `AudioManager.load_audio_from_filepath()` or `AudioManager.load_audio_from_packedscene()` methods.
This way it will be uploaded to the audio pool, where it can be accessed with the **file name**, and the different playback methods in `AudioManager` can be used.
