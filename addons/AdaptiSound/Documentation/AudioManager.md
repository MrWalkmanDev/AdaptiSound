# Audio Manager

This tool is designed with the objective of implementing global background music and/or sounds. `AudioManager` will only play a single `BGM` track, and in parallel one of `BGS`.

- The `current_playback` variable stores the only currently playing BGM
- The `current_bgs_playback` variable stores the only current playback of the BGS.

`AudioManager` will automatically preload audio files for when `playback methods` are called.

There are two categories of files that can be played: Simple Audio files: .wav, .mp3, .ogg, and AdaptiNodes (AudioInteractive, AudioSynchronized), which are nodes created to implement adaptive music.
To learn more about these nodes see LINK

## Audio Pool Methods
### load_audio_from_stream / load_audio_from_packedscene / load_audio_from_filepath
![img](https://i.imgur.com/5RELwHp.png[/img])

These three methods load the files into the pool that can be played using the AudioManager methods.
You can load a simple audio file, a scene from an AdaptiNode, or the filepath of an audio file or AdaptiNode scene.
* `sound_name`: Assign the name with which the track will be called
* `category`: Assigns the track's category. You can use AudioManager.BGM or AudioManager.BGS.

### remove_audio_from_pool

![img](https://i.imgur.com/9o2i5EL.png[/img])

Removes a pre-loaded audio from the pool
* `sound_name`: name of the audio to delete

### create_audio_tracks

![img](https://i.imgur.com/6Jzgdse.png[/img])

## General Playback Methods

### `play_music` 
<sub>Only for BGM (AudioFiles and AdaptiNodes)</sub>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/5dz2XBK.png[/img])

This method will play from the beginning the audio with the name assigned in *sound_name*. If there is already an audio being played, it will replace it, unless it is the same one, in which case, it will continue the current playback.

play_music automatically instantiates a track in AudioManager, so there is no need to use create_audio_track first.

- `sound_name:` type `String`, `AudioManager` will look for the preloaded sounds and play audio with this name.
- `vol_db`: type Float, set volume in dB of the track when played. `0.0 default.`
- `fade_in:` `Float`, set the fade time when the track is played. `0.0 default`.
- `fade_out:` type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out. `0.0 default`.

### `reset_music` 
<sub>Only for BGM (AudioFiles and AdaptiNodes)</sub>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/9TxMTd8.png[/img])

This method returns the currently playing track to the beginning.
- `vol_db:` type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out.


### `stop_music` 
<sub>Only for BGM (AudioFiles and AdaptiNodes)</sub>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/6k7mb9D.png[/img])

This method stops the current playback.
- `fade_out:` type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out. `0.0 default`.
- `can_destroy` type `bool`, if true, all tracks removes from the tree. `true default`.

### `stop_all` 
<sub>For All (BGS and BGM)</sub>

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sKLJbHk.png)

This method stops all currently playing BGM/ABGM and BGS tracks, and removes them from the tree.
- `type:` type `String`, set a specific category you want to stop. `"all" default`
- `fade_out:` type `Float`, set the fade time when the current playback out. `1.5 default`
- `can_destroy:` type `Bool`, if true, all tracks removes from the tree. `true default`

- `fade_out:` type `Float`, time of fade out. `0.0 default`.

### `set_initial_clip` 
<sub>Only for BGM AdaptiNodes</sub>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/RUOtcWG.png[/img])

Sets the first clip to play when using the `play_music` method
